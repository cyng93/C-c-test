# C-c-test
C-c-test is use to test C-minus compiler writen throughout ypyou's Compiler Design Course.

# Usage
- Place C-c-test in your C-minus compiler project directory, and that's all!

- There is a directory corresponding to every sub-system of Compiler, which tests sits in each directory.
  i.e., directory `scanner_test` consists of testes that helps to test scanner.

- For each subsystem, we assumed that there should be corresponding rule in Makefile so `run_test.sh` can generate corresponding executable binary to run the test.

- Run `run_test.sh` in each directory for usage.
